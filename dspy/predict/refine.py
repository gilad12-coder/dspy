class Refine(Module):
    """
    Enhances prediction quality through iterative refinement based on a user-provided reward function.

    This module takes a base DSPy module (defined by its `signature`) and attempts to improve its outputs
    over `N` iterations using a reward mechanism controlled by `reward_fn` and `threshold`.

    The `reward_fn` is crucial and **must** perform the following:
    - Accept two arguments: `args` (the original keyword arguments passed to `Refine.forward`) and
      `pred` (the `dspy.Prediction` generated by the internal module in the current iteration).
    - Return a `dspy.Prediction` object. This returned object **must** contain at least two fields:
        - `score` (float or convertible to float): A numerical score indicating the quality of the input `pred`.
        - `feedback` (str): Actionable feedback for the underlying module on how to improve its
          next attempt, especially if the score is below the `threshold`. This feedback will be included
          in the `previous_attempts` context for the next iteration.

    Implementing Programmatic Constraints within `reward_fn`:
    Users can implement basic programmatic checks (like word count, format validation, etc.)
    If these checks fail, the `reward_fn` can return a `dspy.Prediction` with a low score (e.g., 0.0)
    and feedback detailing the constraint failures. The example below demonstrates this pattern.

    The refinement process continues until a prediction achieves a score greater than or equal to the
    `threshold` (after potentially passing internal programmatic checks within `reward_fn`),
    or until `N` iterations are completed. The internal predictor module receives the full
    history of previous outputs, scores, and feedback via the `previous_attempts` input field.

    Example:
    >>> import dspy
